# brushwrks
Brushwrks is a web app and service dedicated to helping art lovers connect with artists. Currently we're in a space where art is either: being commodified for the lowest price and fastest turn-around, or generic subscription models with no personalization and high artist fees. The concept is to have searchable freelancer profiles to help a potential client find the specific type of art they want, while ensuring artists are paid their proper worth. 

Features:
Easy to use interface 
Tag based system for finding artists
'Favorite' artists to come back to later and get updates on open slots/pricing
